# Calling an international number

1. Knowing the originating country `exit code` or more formally [international direct dialing (IDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_call_prefixes). In most countries it's `00` but in US and Canada it's `011`. You can use `+` instead of exit codes
2. Finding the destination country international code. For example for Iran it's 98. So for calling Iran from Canada you need to dial `01198` first
3. Dialing area code. Note that in international number format you shouldn't use [trunk prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_prefix). In Iran and UK it's `0`. For example the area code of Tehran is `21`. So for calling from landline outside Tehran to a phone in Tehran you must dial `021`. But in international format you must omit trunk prefix (e.g. `+9821...`). This [link](https://www.revk.uk/2009/09/it-is-not-44-0207-123-4567.html) is also explain it.
4. Dial the actual number
